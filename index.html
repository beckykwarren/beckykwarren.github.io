            <p>In the modern connected world, data is being captured in a multitude of ways. However, raw data rarely makes sense. As a Data Scientist I analyse and present data in such a way that it can be interpreted intuitively and insights can be teased out. By using graphic representations and appropriate statistical techniques, patterns and trends can be understood more easily and insights can be used to improve our world.</p>
            <p>I am currently taking a Data Science and Visualization Certificate at UC San Diego Extension. The course covers a range of languages and I have enjoyed learning VBA, Python and SQL, as well as some HtML and CSS. The projects I have worked on have allowed me to explore these languages more deeply and I particularly enjoyed using API’s to scrape data from the web.</p>
            <p>At Imperial College, London, I studied for a bachelor's degree in Maths with Statistics.  It was there that I first experienced the joy of coding. I took modules on C++, Matlab and Maple. </p>                        
            <p>After college I became a Maths Teacher. I taught for 7 years and worked with children aged 11 to 18. During this time I developed excellent communication skills and as a result I am able to break down difficult concepts into their constituent parts. I was also the Head of Department for two years, a role that required me to run a team, manage my time and the time of my team effectively and work collaboratively with other colleagues.</p>
            <p>Having left the classroom I worked for <a href="https://nrich.maths.org/" target="_blank">NRICH</a>, a maths education organisation based at Cambridge University, where I rediscovered my love of coding. Part of my role involved maintaining the website where I used html and created some simple interactivities. It was then that I realised I could use my mathematical skills and love of coding together as a Data Scientist.</p>
            <p>I am excited to apply the skills I have learned to solve real life problems.</p>
